## Sub Questions
### 1. How did source code management practices evolve before Git? What were the limitations of previous version control systems (VCS) that Git aimed to address?
**Answer:** Before dedicated version control systems, developers relied on manual methods to manage code changes. This often involved:   

* Copying files: Developers would create copies of files to work on, leading to a proliferation of versions.
* Manual merging: When changes needed to be integrated, developers would manually merge code by hand, a time-consuming and error-prone process.
* Email or FTP: Sharing code was often done through email attachments or FTP, which was inefficient and lacked proper version control.


Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)
To address the limitations of manual methods, centralized version control systems emerged. Examples include SVN (Subversion) and CVS (Concurrent Versions System). These systems introduced a central repository where all code changes were stored.   

**<u>Limitations of CVCS:</u>**

* Single point of failure: The central server was a single point of failure. If it went down, developers could not access or commit code.   
* Limited offline work: Developers required a connection to the central server to commit changes or resolve conflicts.
* Inefficient branching and merging: Branching and merging were often complex and time-consuming processes.

Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)
Git, a DVCS, was developed to address the shortcomings of CVCS. In a DVCS, each developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its history. This offers several advantages:   

* Improved reliability: No single point of failure.
* Efficient branching and merging: Git excels at creating and merging branches.   
* Offline work: Developers can work offline and synchronize changes later.
* Faster performance: Local operations are generally faster than in CVCS.
